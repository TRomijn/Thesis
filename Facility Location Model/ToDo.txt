Model:

	implement allocation
		simple allocation: Closest to facility
		complex allocation: Gutjahr
	add objectives
		travel times
		social costs

		other: efficiency, effectiveness, equity


EMA_workbench:
	create evaluator function, that takes model and specific values, so that model can be optimised using the EMA workbench and for later use in the robustness analysis

	An instantiated case should be loaded into the ema_workbench.
		Use constants to do this. Use a loop that loads all variables in the EMA workbench, so to not have to do it manually
